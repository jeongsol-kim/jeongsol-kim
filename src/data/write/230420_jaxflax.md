**JAX** is a library made by Google for scientific calculation which support various useful features including parallel computation, GPU acceleration, and auto-grad. Basically, it is for general computation, but it also enables accelerated and parallel machine learning. This project provide multiple examples of deep learning methods for image processing by adopting FLAX, another library by Google that helps easier imple$mentation of neural networks.
